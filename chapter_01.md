# What is Python ?

Python is one of the most popular programming language. Python is an interpreted programming language. 
It is also a general purpose programming language that has wide variety of applications. It is dynamically typed , object-oriented language.

> Python Language is named after BBC show "Monty Python's Flying Circus" and has nothing to do with reptiles. Still many people confuse with the :snake:.


# Why Python ?

### 1. Interpreted :
+ Python is an interpreted language. In simple terms interpreted means going line by line. Python does exactly the same it executes your code line by line. Since it is interpreted, we don't have to repeatedly do "_compile and run_" kind of thing.
+ By leveraging this trait of python we can do a lot of experimentation with the code and can perform many small and simple tasks.
+ You can learn more about the interpreter more [Here](chapter_02.md)

### 2. Modules :
+ We can split python programs into **Modules**.
+ We can understand module as a package that can be reused over and over again.
+ Python has a large collection of built-in modules which offer many things like I/O, system calls, socket,..... The list goes on.

### 3. Math Influence :
+ Python is primarily based on various math properties. We can observe that most of the times the operaters that we use and operations that we perform are influenced from **_Mathematics_**.


### 4. Extensible :
+ The Python interpreter is made by using _C Programming Language_. So we can add new module / built-in functions into python interpreter very easily.
+ Because of this we can interface Python with libraries written in other languages too [^1].


[^1]: Mainly C , C++ but we can use C as a bridge and can connect with other languages as well.
